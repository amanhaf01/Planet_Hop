Second video game coded in programming language 'Lua' and tested in LOVE2D. Pixel art done in GIMP.

HOW TO DOWNLOAD: Download the file by clicking on the GREEN "Code" buttom above. It will download all files in a zip folder. Unzip the folder, and inside you will see seven (7) items. You can delete the four (4) PNG image files, they are just screenshots from the game. You can also delete the folder "Star Shooter - Code" unless you would like to format the code for the game. The folder "Star Shooter - Final Game" is the folder with the playable game! Leave this folder in tact, you can move it to your desktop or any other location, as long as all eight (8) items stay within that folder. There should be seven (7) .dll files along with an .exe file titled StarShooter. Double click and enjoy!

INSTRUCTIONS/ HOW TO PLAY: Press 'enter' to start the game. After the timer counts down from 3, press the spacebar to make the spaceship "hop". Time the pressing of the spacebar right so that you stay floating and don't hit the alien apartments! See how far you can go!
